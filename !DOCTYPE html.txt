    <h2>Apology and Invitation Letter</h2>
    <p><strong>To:</strong> Lesego Sonia Mokhonoana<br>
       <strong>From:</strong> Matlhatsi Paul Letwaba</p>

    <p>Dear Sonia,</p>
    <p>I hope you are well. I am writing this letter because I owe you a true apology. What I did — flirting with another girl while being with you — was wrong. I cannot defend myself because there is no excuse for that. I take full responsibility, and I regret hurting you.</p>

    <p>The past three weeks have given me time to think deeply. I asked myself why I acted that way, and I realized it was because I got too comfortable and lazy in love. I stopped putting in the effort you deserve. I see now that your presence gave me strength, confidence, and joy in life. Without you, life has felt empty. These weeks opened my eyes, and I know now the kind of man I want to be: someone who values, respects, and loves you the way you deserve.</p>

    <div class="invitation">
      <p><strong>Invitation</strong><br>
      In an effort to demonstrate my commitment to change and to rebuild our bond, I would like to formally invite you to join me for a movie outing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Event:</strong> Movie Date</li>
        <li><strong>Date:</strong> 31 August 2025</li>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Mall of the North</li>
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> To be mutually agreed upon based on your preferred movie schedule</li>
        <li><strong>Host:</strong> Matlhatsi Paul Letwaba (all expenses will be covered)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The purpose of this invitation is not only to spend quality time together but also to show you that I am ready to actively invest in us, moving forward with honesty, respect, and care. Should you feel that being with me is not possible at this time, I completely understand, and I will respect your decision. Even after the movie, if you feel that the connection is not there, you can say that, and I will accept it.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>If you choose not to come</strong><br>
    If you feel you cannot handle being with me anymore, I will respect your decision. I still want to thank you for everything. You have been a big part of my life, and I will always appreciate you. I know I will regret what I did for a long time, but I will carry the lessons with me forever.</p>

    <p>Even if we do not get back together, I truly wish you happiness. I hope you find someone who treats you even better than I did — someone who gives you all the love, respect, and care you deserve. But I will still wait for you to come back because I believe we are made for each other; I just ruined it.</p>

    <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this.</p>

    <p>With respect and regret,<br>
    <strong>Matlhatsi Paul Letwaba</strong></p>
